How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery

The way I made this project was that by using javascrpt the user and hover over a arrow button. (They know it is selected because when you hover over the button it chages color). Once the button is clicked it activates a click function that gets an imag from my array that I set up in my js file and append to the DOM an img tag source that dispay my favorite food.

Optimizations

If I had a chance to go back I woul Allow the user to pick through the images at and decided and when you click on the image it gives you the ingredients and cooking instructions for that treat.

Lessons Learned:
I learned that arrys cn be tricy to handle. I hard a card time take elements out of my arraw and using that to append to the DOM and then realized that you dont append the images you append the source of that image to the img tag.
